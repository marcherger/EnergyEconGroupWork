  abstract = {In the future energy system, it is likely that there is more variation in the electricity prices due to higher share of renewable energy sources in electricity production. In this paper, the effects of more variable electricity prices were analyzed in a district heating (DH) system that includes both combined heat and power (CHP) plant, fired mainly by biomass and heat only boilers. The most cost optimal dimensioning and combination of heat storages, heat pumps and solar collectors are searched in three future electricity price scenarios. When the impacts of different system components were analyzed separately, it was found that especially a larger heat storage (1% of annual DH energy) is economical. In addition, the results indicate that the most economical size for a heat pump is around 20% of peak heat demand. Yet, the most profitable solution was to include both a heat storage and a heat pump in the DH system. According to our results, solar collector was not a profitable investment in the studied DH system.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, buildings consume a large amount of conventional energy sources in European countries and subsequently they contribute significantly to fossil fuels emissions. Therefore, many European countries have introduced several policies to minimize this consumption by transitioning buildings into more energy efficient ones, whereas some other policies focus on integrating renewables into energy systems. In this context, solar district heating is one of the promising technologies that reduces the use of fossils and, thereby, leads to fewer CO2 emissions. The main drawback of solar energy, however, is that it fluctuates on daily and seasonal basis in which the highest heat availability is in summer, while the highest demand is in winter. Hence, a seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) is required to bridge the temporal mismatch between renewable energy availability and buildings’ demand. Accordingly, this study reviews briefly the different seasonal thermal energy storage technologies that are feasible for district heating applications. Then, the paper focuses chiefly on large-scale hot water TES (tanks and pits). Construction (geometry and envelope), modeling and design of these TES systems are the primary focus. Next, system performance indicators are also reviewed. A synopsis of the current TES systems is eventually presented as well. The literature review reveals: (1) Tank TES (TTES) and pit TES (PTES) are less subjected to hydro- geological conditions than aquifer TES (ATES) and borehole TES (BTES), (2) TTES and PTES require high construction cost compared to ATES and BTES, (3) TTES and PTES provide higher charging/discharging power than ATES and BTES due to higher operational temperature difference and flowrates, (4) in hot water TES, as the depth decreases, the more the stratification tends to degrade and, therefore, tanks are preferable over pits, (5) no established co-simulation platform between TES envelope and surroundings coupled to energy analysis models and (6) no effective approach or measure has been found to evaluate one TES to another.},

  abstract = {The European Energy Exchange (EEX) day ahead spot market for electricity in Germany shows significant variations in prices between peak and off-peak hours. Being able to shift electricity production from off-peak hours to peak hours improves the profit from CHP-plant operation significantly. Installing a big thermal store at a CHP-plant makes it possible to shift production of electricity and heat to hours where electricity prices are highest especially on days with low heat demand. Consequently, these conditions will have to influence the design of new CHP-plants. In this paper, the optimal size of a CHP-plant with thermal store under German spot market conditions is analyzed. As an example the possibility to install small size CHP-plant instead of only boilers at a Stadtwerke delivering 30,000MWh-heat for district heating per year is examined using the software energyPRO. It is shown that, given the economic and technical assumptions made, a CHP-plant of 4MW-el with a thermal store participating in the spot market will be the most feasible plant to build. A sensitivity analysis shows to which extent the optimal solution will vary by changing the key economic assumptions.},
